# Discord Auto Counter - Security Best Practices

## Understanding Discord Terms of Service

Using automated tools with Discord user accounts ("self-bots") is against Discord's Terms of Service:

> "You may not use our API to build...bots that facilitate automation on more than one account."

This bot uses user tokens to authenticate and perform actions on Discord. Be aware of the following risks:

- **Account Termination**: Discord may terminate accounts used for automation
- **IP Bans**: Repeated violations may result in IP-level restrictions
- **API Access Restrictions**: Rate limits may be applied more aggressively

## Token Security

Discord user tokens grant full access to your account. Protect them carefully:

### Token Storage Best Practices

1. **Never share your token**
   - Your token provides complete account access
   - Never share it, even with trusted individuals

2. **Secure token storage**
   - Store tokens in a secure location separate from code
   - Consider using environment variables instead of config files
   - Example:
     ```python
     import os
     token = os.environ.get('DISCORD_TOKEN')
     ```

3. **Token rotation**
   - Change your password periodically to generate a new token
   - Logout from all other sessions after changing password

4. **Token obfuscation**
   - Never commit tokens to public repositories
   - Add config files to `.gitignore`
   - Example:
     ```
     # .gitignore
     counter_config.json
     *.token
     .env
     ```

### Signs of Token Compromise

Watch for these signs that may indicate your token has been compromised:

1. Unexpected login notifications from new locations
2. Messages or actions you did not perform
3. Account settings changes you did not make
4. Friend requests or DMs you did not initiate
5. Unusual rate limit errors suggesting additional use

If you suspect compromise, immediately:
1. Change your Discord password (this invalidates all tokens)
2. Enable two-factor authentication if not already enabled
3. Review authorized applications in Discord settings
4. Check for unfamiliar login history

## Network Security

### HTTPS/TLS Security

The bot uses HTTPS for all API communication:

```python
# URL always begins with https://
url = f"https://discord.com/api/v9/channels/{channel_id}/messages"
```

Ensure your environment has:
- Updated SSL/TLS libraries
- Proper certificate validation
- No certificate pinning bypasses

### Proxy Considerations

If using proxies to distribute requests:

```python
# Example of proxy configuration
proxies = {
    'http': 'http://proxy.example.com:8080',
    'https': 'https://proxy.example.com:8080'
}
session.proxies = proxies
```

- Use only trusted proxies
- Encrypt proxy communication when possible
- Be aware proxy servers can view all traffic
- Consider dedicated proxies rather than public ones

## Rate Limit Security

### Avoiding Detection

Excessive traffic patterns may trigger additional scrutiny:

```python
# Gradually increase message rate
if ramp_up_mode and successful_messages > 0:
    # Start slow and gradually increase speed
    current_rate = min(target_rate, 
                      initial_rate * (1 + 0.1 * successful_messages))
```

- Implement gradual ramp-up periods
- Add random delays between actions
- Avoid perfectly regular timing patterns
- Decrease activity during unusual hours

### Handling Rate Limits

Proper rate limit handling is essential for security:

```python
if response.status_code == 429:
    data = response.json()
    # Check for global rate limit
    if data.get('global', False):
        logger.warning("GLOBAL rate limit hit - highly suspicious activity detected")
        time.sleep(data.get('retry_after', 60) + random.uniform(5, 15))
    else:
        logger.info("Standard rate limit - adjusting speed")
        time.sleep(data.get('retry_after', 5) + random.uniform(0.5, 2))
```

- Always honor `retry_after` values
- Add additional random delay to rate limit responses
- Reduce activity after receiving rate limits
- Track and analyze rate limit patterns

## Behavior Pattern Security

### Human-like Behavior

Implement features that mimic human behavior:

```python
def simulate_typing(self, channel_id, duration=None):
    """Simulate typing indicator in channel"""
    if not duration:
        # Calculate typing duration based on message length
        msg_length = len(str(self.current_count))
        duration = random.uniform(0.5, 1.0) + (msg_length * 0.1)
    
    # Start typing indicator
    url = f"https://discord.com/api/v9/channels/{channel_id}/typing"
    response = self.session.post(url)
    
    # Typing indicators last 10 seconds, but we'll simulate
    # a more human-like variable typing duration
    time.sleep(duration)
```

Additional patterns to implement:
- Variable message timing (not perfectly regular)
- Occasional typos and corrections
- Natural breaks in activity
- Response to other users' messages

## Multi-Account Security

When using multiple accounts:

### Account Separation

```python
# Separate account usage patterns
def get_next_account(self):
    # Don't use same account consecutively if possible
    if len(self.accounts) > 1:
        available = [i for i in range(len(self.accounts)) 
                     if i != self.last_account_index]
        return random.choice(available)
    return 0
```

- Use different user agents per account
- Vary typing patterns between accounts
- Create natural usage patterns for each account
- Maintain separate IP addresses if possible

### Activity Patterns

```python
# Different accounts should behave differently
def configure_account_behavior(self, account_index):
    # Each account has slightly different behavior patterns
    patterns = {
        0: {"typing_speed": "fast", "error_rate": 0.02, "delay_variance": 0.8},
        1: {"typing_speed": "medium", "error_rate": 0.01, "delay_variance": 1.2},
        2: {"typing_speed": "slow", "error_rate": 0.005, "delay_variance": 1.5}
    }
    
    pattern = patterns.get(account_index, 
                          {"typing_speed": "medium", "error_rate": 0.01, "delay_variance": 1.0})
    
    return pattern
```

## Privacy Considerations

### Data Collection

The bot collects and stores:
- Message content
- User IDs and usernames
- Timestamps
- Channel information

Ensure this data is:
- Stored securely
- Only used for bot operation
- Deleted when no longer needed
- Not shared with third parties

### Log Security

```python
# Secure logging practices
logger = logging.getLogger("counter_bot")
# Redact sensitive information
def secure_log(message, level="info", sensitive_data=None):
    """Log message with sensitive data redacted"""
    if sensitive_data:
        for key, value in sensitive_data.items():
            if value and len(str(value)) > 4:
                # Redact all but first/last 2 chars
                redacted = str(value)[:2] + "*" * (len(str(value)) - 4) + str(value)[-2:]
                message = message.replace(str(value), redacted)
    
    if level == "info":
        logger.info(message)
    elif level == "warning":
        logger.warning(message)
    elif level == "error":
        logger.error(message)
```

- Avoid logging tokens or sensitive data
- Secure log file permissions
- Implement log rotation and cleanup
- Consider encrypted logs for sensitive information

## Configuration Security

### Secure Default Configuration

The default configuration should prioritize security:

```json
{
  "messages_per_second": 1.0,
  "verify_last_message": true,
  "human_mode": true,
  "aggressive_mode": false,
  "scan_interval": 30,
  "auto_reset": false
}
```

- Start with conservative settings
- Require explicit opt-in for aggressive features
- Implement incremental speed increases
- Default to more human-like behavior

### Configuration Validation

```python
def validate_config(self, config):
    """Validate configuration and apply security limits"""
    if "messages_per_second" in config:
        # Cap at reasonable maximum
        config["messages_per_second"] = min(config["messages_per_second"], 10.0)
    
    # Ensure critical security settings
    if config.get("aggressive_mode", False):
        logger.warning("Aggressive mode enabled - higher detection risk")
    
    return config
```

## System Security

### Isolation

For maximum security:
- Run the bot in an isolated environment
- Use a dedicated machine or virtual machine
- Consider containerization (Docker)
- Implement network isolation

Example Docker setup:
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

# Run with limited permissions
RUN adduser --disabled-password --gecos '' botuser
USER botuser

CMD ["python", "auto_counter.py"]
```

### Dependency Security

Keep dependencies updated and secure:
- Use specific versions in requirements.txt
- Regularly update dependencies
- Scan for security vulnerabilities
- Minimize third-party dependencies

```
# requirements.txt with pinned versions
requests==2.28.1
python-dateutil==2.8.2
```

## Emergency Response Plan

### Detecting Issues

Monitor for:
- Unusual rate limiting
- Account warnings from Discord
- Unexpected login notifications
- Unusual IP access in logs

### Emergency Shutdown

Implement an emergency shutdown:

```python
def emergency_shutdown(self, reason):
    """Immediately shutdown bot operations"""
    logger.critical(f"EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN: {reason}")
    
    # Stop all threads
    self.counting_active = False
    self.should_exit = True
    
    # Invalidate sessions
    for account in self.accounts:
        account.session.close()
    
    # Save emergency state
    with open("emergency_shutdown.log", "w") as f:
        f.write(f"Emergency shutdown at {datetime.now()}: {reason}\n")
    
    # Exit process in extreme cases
    if reason == "CRITICAL_SECURITY_BREACH":
        sys.exit(1)
```

### Account Recovery

If your account is compromised or warned:
1. Change password immediately
2. Enable 2FA if not already enabled
3. Logout of all other sessions
4. Review account activity
5. Contact Discord support if needed
